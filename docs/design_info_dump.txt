General Consensus for pretty much ALL booking websites for airfare:

Destination (Both to and from)
Dates(Departure dates to and from)
Travelers (Number of people…)
Types of Tickets(Roundtrip, One-way, Multi City)
Seats (Economy, Premium economy, Business Class, First Class)
Flight insurance (Price drop protection)

Steps to Purchase Tickets organized (By Website) if needed for creating an booking process
  algorithm/pseudocode:
 
Expedia:
 
1.Input all flight information needed. Flight type, etc.       
2. User chooses flight time and chooses and airline to fly with. Depending on software, list may be
  sorted by airline.
3. Once the user picks and airline they need to choose their flight class, reiterating business, first
  class, economy, etc. This step is where the user can choose to add price drop protection.
4. User may choose the returning flight information; user will adjust accordingly depending on their
  flight details. If the user hasn’t added flight protection this is where the user may add.
5.User may choose seats.
6. User inputs government details and such. Email, phone, etc.
7.Once again if the user forgot to add flight protection and such, this step prompts the user again to
  see if maybe they changed their mind.  
8.User inputs payment details.  CC/ DC billing address
9.User completes ticket booking process. User is prompted to check email for a confirmation /proof of
  purchase. Yay
  
Booking.com:
 
Beginning process is similar To other websites. Only difference is UI…number of travelers, destination,
  etc.
 
1. User chooses flight details. To reiterate: Round trip, One way, Multi city, so type of flight and also
  the flight class.
2.User may choose the type of airline they want to fly with, choose departure time and date and return
  time and date.
3. User may choose flight class again if they forgot.
4. User is prompted to fill out their contact details (phone # and email). The user may also choose to
  receive SMS notifications on the status of their flight.
5.User is prompted to fill out traveler information (legal info)
6.User may also choose to have flight protection at this step.
7.User is prompted to fill out their preferred method of payment.
8. Flight is booked once the user confirms!
 
Kayak:
 
1. User is prompted to choose departure date and time just like the other booking services.
2. User chooses if they want a direct flight or a different flight type. Almost identical to the other
  websites.
3. User may choose if they want checked bags at this step.
4. User may add traveler details based off of their government information.
If the user has a frequent flyer status, they may opt to use their points at this step.
5. User chooses seats at this step.
6. Finally, the user may choose to insure their flight.
7. User inputs payment information..
8. User purchases ticket.

Management: Joint between admins, airline officials, and the public.
Scheduling for pilots/ground staff, assign flights to gates and time of departure, air traffic management
  for handling/ parking for planes. 
Jobs: check-in, bag checks, security, retail, maintenance, and customer service.
Use nicknames for airplanes to make managing easier and codenames for flights.

Topic: (Airport management, customer service and TSA operations.)

Airports function like small towns or cities
There is a general manager who oversees the airport 
there are a bunch of other smaller managers who oversee specific tasks in the airport
-Operations manager
- Safety manager
- Environmental manager
-General manager
airports must operate in accordance with the regulations from the FAA and TSA
tsa officers will check tickets, luggage and x-ray passengers for contraband
Airport customer services can change customer flights 
Most airplane tracking actually works through crowdsourcing
AODB functions include:
Reference-data processing
Seasonal scheduling
Daily flight schedule processing
Processing of payments
The most important information that this database holds is the seasonal schedule. It displays information
  about commercial flight movements for a season. It contains the flight code, type of aircraft, their
  estimated arrival and departure times, multi-stop flights, operation days of the week, exception dates,
  and other relevant information. This information entered manually or downloaded allocates such
  resources as arrival or departure gates, air-bridges and stands, check-in desks.
Check in kiosks can be used by customers
