  Airport Customer Service
  Processing of Payments
  Online Ticket Sale Confirmation

Customers
  Online Portal to pay for tickets
    Destination (Both to and from)
    Dates (Departure dates to and from)
    Travelers (Number of people)
    Types of Tickets (Roundtrip, One way, Multi-City)
    Seats (Economy, Premium Economy, Business Class, First Class)
    Flight Insurance (Price drop protection)

There needs to be a security layer, so that Customers do not have access to Airport staff information.
  Employees should only be able to access information relevant to their role. Management should have
  access to their own information, and the information within all employee dashboards.

It should not be possible for Customers to forge air travel ticket orders, some verification proving
  authenticity is necessary.
Routing software for flights should be able to handle cancellations, inclement weather, crew schedules,
  and should be limited to domestic travel to reduce complexity. 
Airline software should be robust enough to handle all sorts of test cases, unit tests would need to be
  designed.
